# Weld_Defect-Classification-using-ResNet
The dataset is imported from Kaggle. The link of Kaggle dataset is "https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarahmacleans/detection-of-weld-defects". 
There are 6 different classes of weld defects and are given below:
good weld           0 , burn through        1 ,  contamination       2 ,  lack of fusion      3 , misalignment        4 , lack of penetration 5

The data is not in structured form (classwise). So, i have used the JSON file for mapping data from the respective class after loading it from above source.
